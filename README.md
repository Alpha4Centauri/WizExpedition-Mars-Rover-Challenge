The 2022 WizExpedition Mars Rover Challenge was a US & Canada wide competition for 6th-10th graders to develop their own Perseverance Rover model capable of storing 500 g samples with 40" x 20" x 20" chassis dimensions, mechanical automation, and AI functionality. The rover I developed is named R-Strive Heights, and incorporates a custom YOLOv5 object detection model to detect rock samples and activate a servo motor to open the storage compartment.
